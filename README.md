some practice using Haskell

## Definition of recursive functions:

a) without using built-in functions
b) with using built-in functions.

1. Find the last element of the list,

2. Remove from the list elements from the i-th to the k-th inclusive, e.g. at i=2 and
k=4: "asdfghj"⇒ "ashj".


## High order functions:

a) without using built-in functions
b) with using built-in functions.

1. Rewrite the list from right to left.

2. Mixing a list of n elements: after the first place the last
first, after the second - penultimate, etc. 

For example, the incoming list "abcde1234" should be transformed to "a1b2c3d4e".

## Types and classes of types

quantity)
